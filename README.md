### Step 1: Get all the brand links and product links from Sephora and save them into text file.

### Step 2: Get product information from each product links and save them into Excel file.

### Notes: 
   1) Not all the information can be obtained as some products have different page design. Therefore, beautiful soup has limits to scrape the data. In this current version, I just simply use na to replace those information that is null or goes error.
   2) Reviews are not obtained for the current version.
   3) Data analytics was simple when I did this project. Coding for this part will be uploaded later.
